# linuxGestures
My first linux/C app that makes touchpad accessible with:
          3 finger swipe(xdotool):
            Up: shows all open windows
            Down: close view of all open windows
            Left: toggle across windows to the left
            Right: toggle across windows to the right
          4 fingers swipe(pactl): 
            Up: Volume up
            Down: Volume down
